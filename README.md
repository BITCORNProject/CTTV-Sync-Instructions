# CTTV-Sync-Instructions
In these instructions we will cover how to get a Bitcorn Address

## Steps for ALL subs 
1. Follow our twitch bot by going to the [**BITCORNhub channel**](https://www.twitch.tv/bitcornhub) and clicking on the heart to follow. This is so the bot can send you whispers.

2. Go to the [**Sync Website**](https://bitcornsync.com/) and sync in this order:
    1. Twitch (**REQUIRED**)
    2. Twitter (Optional, but recommended for use on this platform)
    3. Discord (Optional if not a T3 sub, but recommended)
    4. BITCORN (if you don't already have a bitcorn address)
    
**For T3 Subs**
3. Wait (up to 15 minutes) for everything to sync up for your **Tier 3 Astronaut** sub role to appear in discord, you're done!
