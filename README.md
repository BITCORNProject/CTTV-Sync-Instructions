# CTTV-Sync-Instructions
In these instructions we will cover how to sync your discord role with your twitch sub level for the CTTV twitch stream

## Steps for ALL subs 
1. Follow our twitch bot by going to the [**BITCORNhub channel**](https://www.twitch.tv/bitcornhub) and clicking on the heart to follow. This is so the bot can send you whispers.
