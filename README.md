# CTTV-Sync-Instructions
In these instructions we will cover how to sync your discord role with your twitch sub level for the CTTV twitch stream

## Steps
1. Follow our twitch bot by going to the [**BITCORNhub channel**](https://www.twitch.tv/bitcornhub) and clicking on the heart to follow.

2. Type `$reg` in the CTTV twitch chat.  This will register you for a BITCORN address and create a record for you to sync with.
3. go to the [**sync website**](https://bitcornsync.com/) and sync twitch first, then sync discord. Note: you can optionally sync twitter as well as we will be implementing a reward system for retweeting CTTV and BITCORN tweets in the future. 
4. Wait for everything to sync up, you're done!
